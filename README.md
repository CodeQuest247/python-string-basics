# String Processing Program (Python)

This is a beginner **Python** program that practices working with strings, loops, and character counting.

The program includes three sections:
1. Counts the total number of characters in a string  
2. Counts both uppercase and lowercase vowels in a string  
3. Splits a full name into first and last name and counts the characters in each  

This project demonstrates basic Python skills such as:
- String input and traversal
- Using `len()`
- For loops and conditionals
- String splitting and character analysis
